## Overview

The starter code contained a style guide, image assets (designs and image resources), and a data.json object with the necessary data.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
